## 📋 Requirements

- Go 1.19 or higher
- Internet connection
- Root/Administrator privileges (for certain scanning modes)
- Sufficient system resources for large-scale scans

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ALW1EZ/camtruder.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd camtruder

# Build the binary
go build -o camtruder

# Make it executable (Linux/macOS)
chmod +x camtruder
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Scan a single IP
./camtruder -t 192.168.1.100

# Scan a network range
./camtruder -t 192.168.1.0/24

# Search by location with detailed output
./camtruder -t london -s
> [ NET-ISP ] [ 192.168.1.0/24 ] [256]

# Get raw CIDR ranges for location
./camtruder -t london -ss
> 192.168.1.0/24

# Scan multiple IPs from file
./camtruder -t targets.txt

# Pipe from port scanners (ports are automatically stripped)
naabu -host 192.168.1.0/24 -p 554 | camtruder
masscan 192.168.1.0/24 -p554 --rate 1000 | awk '{print $6}' | camtruder
zmap -p554 192.168.0.0/16 | camtruder

# Internet scan (scan till 100 hits)
./camtruder -t 100
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Custom credentials with increased threads
./camtruder -t 192.168.1.0/24 -u admin,root -p pass123,admin123 -w 50

# Location search with raw output piped to zmap
./camtruder -t berlin -ss | while read range; do zmap -p 554 $range; done

# Save results to file (as full url, you can use mpv --playlist=results.txt to watch the streams)
./camtruder -t istanbul -o results.txt

# Internet scan with limit of 50 workers and verbose output
./camtruder -t 100 -w 50 -v
```
